# Oscope
Poor man's oscilloscope

This project aims to provide a simple oscilloscope that can be used with compatible Arduinos (at least those with an Atmega328). It improves the versions of John Porter (http://www.instructables.com/id/Arduino-Improved-Poor-Mans-Oscilloscope/) and Accrochages (http://accrochages.drone.ws/).

Oscope is based on Processing (https://processing.org/) and Arduino.

It has the following features:

- vertical: 10mV to 1V per division
- horizontal: 1ms to 2s per division
- sampling frequency of 11kHz
- signal measurements: max, min, mean, rms, current, samp. freq.
- help window
- ability to shift the waveform
- ability to pause
- ability to measure time using the mouse pointer
 
Have fun!
